# Averageddeepdenoiser
Source code for "On the Construction of Averaged Deep Denoisers for Image Regularization" https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07321

The code is under construction. For now, training codes and two examples to use contractive FBS denoiser and averaged DRS denoiser are uploaded

We are using pytorch_wavelets library which requires Python 3.12.0 or above. Also, since the algorithms involve patch aggregation, GPU support is also required for inference.
